## 1. What is the difference between HTML and HTML5?

**Answer:**
HTML5 is the latest version of HTML. It introduced new features and APIs to make web applications more dynamic and interactive. Some of the key differences are:
- New semantic elements like `<section>`, `<article>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`, etc.
- Support for local storage (Web Storage API).
- New form elements like `<input type="email">`, `<input type="date">`, etc.
- Native support for multimedia (audio and video elements).
- New attributes like `autofocus`, `placeholder`, `required`, etc.
- Removal of deprecated tags like `<font>`, `<center>`, and `<big>`.

## 2. What are semantic HTML elements, and why are they important?

**Answer:**
Semantic HTML elements are those that clearly describe their meaning in a human- and machine-readable way. Examples include `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, and `<section>`. They improve code readability, accessibility, and SEO. By using semantic tags, developers ensure that content is structured logically, which benefits both the user experience and search engine optimization.

## 3. Explain the difference between block-level elements and inline elements in HTML.

**Answer:**
- **Block-level elements**: These elements take up the full width available, and they always start on a new line. Examples include `<div>`, `<p>`, `<h1>`, and `<section>`.
- **Inline elements**: These elements only take up as much width as necessary, and they do not start on a new line. Examples include `<span>`, `<a>`, and `<img>`.

## 4. What is the purpose of the `alt` attribute in an `<img>` tag?

**Answer:**
The `alt` attribute is used to provide alternative text for an image if the image cannot be displayed. It is important for accessibility as it helps screen readers describe the image to users who are visually impaired. It also serves as a placeholder text when the image is not available.

## 5. What are the differences between the `<div>` and `<span>` tags?

**Answer:**
- **`<div>`**: A block-level element used to group content and apply styles or scripts. It takes up the full width of its container and starts on a new line.
- **`<span>`**: An inline element used to style a portion of text or content within a block-level element without disrupting the flow of content. It does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as its content.

## 6. What are HTML forms and their types of input fields?

**Answer:**
HTML forms are used to collect user input. They are created using the `<form>` tag. Some common input fields include:
- `<input>`: Used for various types of user inputs like text, password, email, etc.
- `<textarea>`: A multi-line text input field.
- `<select>`: A dropdown list.
- `<button>`: A clickable button for submitting or triggering actions.
- `<fieldset>`: Groups related elements inside a form.

## 7. What is the purpose of the `<meta>` tag in HTML?

**Answer:**
The `<meta>` tag provides metadata about the HTML document, such as the character set, author, viewport settings, and more. It is placed inside the `<head>` section of the document. Common uses include:
- `<meta charset="UTF-8">` – Specifies the character encoding.
- `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">` – Controls the layout on mobile devices.

## 8. What is the difference between `id` and `class` attributes?

**Answer:**
- **`id`**: An `id` is unique and identifies a single element in the document. It can only be used once per page.
- **`class`**: A `class` is used to group elements for styling or scripting. It can be applied to multiple elements within the same document.

## 9. What are the HTML5 APIs you have worked with?

**Answer:**
Some common HTML5 APIs that I have worked with include:
- **Canvas API**: Allows dynamic, scriptable rendering of 2D shapes and bitmap images.
- **Geolocation API**: Used to retrieve geographical location information from the browser.
- **LocalStorage/SessionStorage**: Allows storing data on the client-side to persist between page reloads (LocalStorage) or for the duration of the session (SessionStorage).
- **Web Workers**: Allows for background thread processing to avoid blocking the main thread.
- **Drag and Drop API**: Provides functionality for dragging and dropping items within the webpage.

## 10. Explain the concept of the Document Object Model (DOM).

**Answer:**
The DOM is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It represents the page as a tree structure where each node is an object representing a part of the page (such as an element, attribute, or text). JavaScript can be used to manipulate the DOM, modifying the content, structure, and style of the web page dynamically.

## 11. What is the difference between `<script>` and `<noscript>`?

**Answer:**
- **`<script>`**: This tag is used to include JavaScript code in an HTML document. It can be placed in the `<head>` or `<body>` section.
- **`<noscript>`**: This tag is used to provide alternative content for users who have disabled JavaScript or whose browsers do not support it. The content inside `<noscript>` is displayed only if JavaScript is not available.

## 12. What are HTML entities? Can you give some examples?

**Answer:**
HTML entities are special characters that have a predefined meaning in HTML. They are used to represent characters that have a special function in HTML, like `<`, `>`, and `&`. Examples include:
- `&lt;` for `<`
- `&gt;` for `>`
- `&amp;` for `&`
- `&quot;` for `"`

## 13. What is the purpose of the `lang` attribute in the `<html>` tag?

**Answer:**
The `lang` attribute specifies the primary language of the document. It helps search engines, translation tools, and screen readers understand the language of the content. For example, `<html lang="en">` indicates that the content is in English.

## 14. How do you optimize an HTML page for search engines (SEO)?

**Answer:**
To optimize an HTML page for SEO:
- Use semantic tags to structure content logically.
- Use descriptive and keyword-rich meta tags like `<meta name="description">`.
- Ensure that the `<title>` tag is concise and relevant to the page content.
- Use header tags (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.) properly to structure headings.
- Use alt attributes for images.
- Create clean, well-structured, and valid HTML code.

## 15. Explain the use of the `viewport` meta tag in HTML5.

**Answer:**
The `viewport` meta tag is used to control the layout on mobile devices. It allows you to specify the visible area of the page and how it should scale on different devices. A common usage is:
```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
