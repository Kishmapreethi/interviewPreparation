# React Interview Questions

## 1. What is React?
React is an open-source, component-based JavaScript library used to develop interactive user interfaces, especially for single-page applications. It was developed by Facebook and is maintained by a community of developers along with Facebook. ReactJS is widely used in the industry for building interactive and dynamic web applications. Its component-based approach and efficient rendering make it a great choice for modern web development.

## 2. Features of ReactJS

**Component-Based Architecture:**
React applications are built using components, which are reusable and independent pieces of UI. This makes the development process more modular and maintainable.

**JSX Syntax:**
React uses a syntax called JSX (JavaScript XML), which allows you to write HTML within JavaScript. This makes the code more readable and easy to understand.

**Virtual DOM:**
React uses a Virtual DOM, which is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM. When changes are made, React updates the Virtual DOM first and then calculates the most efficient way to update the real DOM. This results in better performance.

**State and Props:**
Components in React can have a state, which is an object that holds data that may change over the lifetime of the component. Props (short for properties) are used to pass data from one component to another.

**Lifecycle Methods:**
React components have lifecycle methods that you can use to run code at specific times during the component's life, such as when it is being created, updated, or destroyed.

**Hooks:**
Hooks are a relatively new addition to React that allow you to use state and other React features without writing a class. They make functional components more powerful and easier to manage.

## 3. What is JSX?

JSX, or JavaScript XML, is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code within JavaScript. It is one of the defining features of ReactJS and makes it easier to create React components by combining HTML and JavaScript.

### Key Points about JSX:

**1. HTML-like Syntax in JavaScript:**
With JSX, you can write elements that look like HTML directly within your JavaScript code. This makes the code more readable and easier to understand.

```jsx
const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
