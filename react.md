# React Interview Questions

## 1. What is React?
React is an open-source, component-based JavaScript library used to develop interactive user interfaces, especially for single-page applications. It was developed by **Facebook** and is maintained by a community of developers along with Facebook. React is widely used in the industry for building interactive and dynamic web applications. Its component-based approach and efficient rendering make it a great choice for modern web development.

## 2. Features of ReactJS

- **Component-Based Architecture:**  
  React applications are built using components, which are reusable and independent pieces of UI. This makes the development process more modular and maintainable.

- **JSX Syntax:**  
  React uses a syntax called JSX (JavaScript XML), allowing you to write HTML within JavaScript, improving readability and ease of understanding.

- **Virtual DOM:**  
  React uses a Virtual DOM, a lightweight copy of the actual DOM. When changes are made, React updates the Virtual DOM first and calculates the most efficient way to update the real DOM, resulting in better performance.

- **State and Props:**  
  React components can have a **state** that holds data that may change over time. **Props** (short for properties) are used to pass data from one component to another.

- **Lifecycle Methods:**  
  React components have lifecycle methods to run code at specific times during their life, such as when they are created, updated, or destroyed.

- **Hooks:**  
  Hooks allow you to use state and other React features in functional components without writing a class. They simplify managing state and side effects.

## 3. What is JSX?

JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code within JavaScript. It is one of React's defining features and makes creating components easier by combining HTML and JavaScript.

### Key Points about JSX:
1. **HTML-like Syntax in JavaScript:**  
   JSX allows you to write HTML elements within JavaScript, making the code more readable and easier to understand.

2. **JavaScript Expressions in JSX:**  
   Embed JavaScript expressions within JSX using `{}` to dynamically render content.

3. **Babel Transpilation:**  
   JSX needs to be transpiled into regular JavaScript using tools like **Babel**, converting JSX into `React.createElement()` calls.

4. **Improved Readability:**  
   By combining HTML and JavaScript, JSX enhances code readability and UI component structure understanding.

## 5. What is Virtual DOM?

The **Virtual DOM** is a lightweight, in-memory representation of the real DOM used by React to efficiently manage UI updates. When data changes, React updates the Virtual DOM, compares it to the previous version, and applies minimal changes to the real DOM.

### How the Virtual DOM Works:
1. **Initial Rendering:**  
   A lightweight, in-memory version of the real DOM is created.

2. **State/Props Update:**  
   When state or props change, React updates the Virtual DOM instead of the real DOM.

3. **Diffing Algorithm:**  
   React compares the updated Virtual DOM with the previous version to identify changes.

4. **Patch/Update:**  
   Only the necessary real DOM parts are updated, reducing DOM manipulations and improving performance.

---

## 6. What is Reconciliation?

**Reconciliation** is the process React uses to update the **real DOM** based on changes in the **Virtual DOM**. It ensures the UI reflects the latest application state by applying minimal changes.

### How Reconciliation Works:
1. **Render:**  
   React renders a new Virtual DOM tree when a component’s state or props change.

2. **Diffing:**  
   React compares the new Virtual DOM tree with the previous one to identify changes.

3. **Updating:**  
   React updates only the changed parts of the real DOM, avoiding unnecessary re-renders.

---

## 7. What is the Diffing Algorithm?

The **Diffing Algorithm** is part of React’s reconciliation process. It compares the new Virtual DOM with the previous one and determines the minimal set of changes needed to update the real DOM efficiently.

### Key Steps in the Diffing Algorithm:
1. **Tree Comparison:**  
   React breaks the Virtual DOM into a tree and compares the new tree with the old one from the root.

2. **Element Type Comparison:**  
   If elements at the same position have different types (e.g., `<div>` replaced by `<span>`), React replaces the old element with the new one.

3. **Reordering of Child Elements:**  
   React minimizes operations by reordering existing elements using **keys** to track changes.

4. **Updates Only When Necessary:**  
   React updates only changed parts of the DOM, making the process efficient.

### Benefits:
- **Performance Improvement:**  
  Minimizes real DOM changes, enhancing application performance.
  
- **Efficient Reconciliation:**  
  Ensures a smooth and responsive user experience.

## 8. Difference Between State and Props

| **Feature**         | **State**                                            | **Props**                                                |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**       | A built-in object storing property values specific to a component. | Read-only attributes passed from a parent to a child component. |
| **Mutability**       | Mutable: Can be changed using `setState` or `useState`. | Immutable: Cannot be changed by the receiving component. |
| **Purpose**          | Manages dynamic data that can change over time.       | Passes data and event handlers down to child components.  |
| **Scope**            | Local to the component and managed within it.         | Passed down from parent components to child components.   |
| **Initialization**   | Initialized in the constructor (class) or `useState` (function). | Passed as attributes in JSX.                             |
| **Updates**          | Can be asynchronous and managed by the component.     | Handled by the parent and passed to the child.            |
| **Access**           | Accessed via `this.state` (class) or `useState` (function). | Accessed via `this.props` (class) or function arguments.  |
| **Examples**         | `this.state = { count: 0 };` <br> `const [count, setCount] = useState(0);` | `<ChildComponent prop1={this.state.value} />`            |
| **Usage**            | Best for managing local data and user interactions.   | Best for passing static or dynamic values and callbacks.  |

## 9. What is Prop Drilling?

**Prop Drilling** is a process in React where data is passed from a parent component to deeply nested child components through intermediary components, even if those intermediary components do not need the data. This can make the code harder to maintain and understand, especially in large applications.

### Example of Prop Drilling:
```jsx
function App() {
  const user = { name: "John", age: 30 };
  return <Parent user={user} />;
}

function Parent({ user }) {
  return <Child user={user} />;
}

function Child({ user }) {
  return <GrandChild user={user} />;
}

function GrandChild({ user }) {
  return <div>Hello, {user.name}!</div>;
}

## How to Avoid Prop Drilling in React

Prop drilling can lead to complex and hard-to-maintain code, especially in large applications. Here are effective strategies to avoid it:

---

### 1. **Context API**  
The Context API allows you to share values across components without passing props through each level of the tree.

###2. **StateManagement libraries like React,Recoil**
###3. **HOC**
###4. **Custom HOOKs**

## 10. What are Fragments?

React Fragments are a way to group a list of children elements without adding extra nodes to the DOM. This is particularly useful when rendering multiple elements from a component that should not introduce unnecessary elements to the DOM tree.

### Key Points about React Fragments:

1. **Purpose:**
   - Fragments let you group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM. This helps in maintaining a clean and minimal DOM structure.

2. **Syntax:**
   - You can use the `<React.Fragment>` or the shorthand `<>` syntax.

3. **Example Using `<React.Fragment>`:**

   ```jsx
   import React from 'react';

   function List() {
       return (
           <>
               <li>Item 1</li>
               <li>Item 2</li>
               <li>Item 3</li>
           </>
       );
   }

## 11. What are Pure Components?

A Pure Component in React is a type of component that optimizes performance by reducing unnecessary re-renders. It does this by implementing a shallow comparison on the component's props and state. If the props and state haven't changed, the component will not re-render.

### Key Features of Pure Components:

1. **Shallow Comparison:**
   - Pure Components perform a shallow comparison of the current props and state with the next props and state. If there are no changes, the component will not re-render.

2. **Increased Performance:**
   - By preventing unnecessary re-renders, Pure Components can improve the performance of your application, especially for components that receive complex props or state.

3. **Usage:**
   - To create a Pure Component, you can extend `React.PureComponent` instead of `React.Component`.

### Example:

```jsx
import React, { PureComponent } from 'react';

class MyComponent extends PureComponent {
    render() {
        console.log('Rendering MyComponent');
        return <div>{this.props.value}</div>;
    }
}

// Usage
<MyComponent value="Hello" />

## 10. Difference between class and functional components?

| Feature                    | Class Components                         | Functional Components                    |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**              | Defined using the `class` keyword and extends `React.Component` | Defined as a JavaScript function          |
| **State**                   | Can have state, using `this.state`       | Uses `useState` hook for state           |
| **Lifecycle Methods**       | Can use lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount` | Uses `useEffect` hook for lifecycle logic |
| **Props**                   | Accessed using `this.props`              | Accessed directly as function arguments  |
| **Binding**                 | Requires manual binding of `this` for event handlers | Does not need `this` binding             |
| **Performance**             | Slightly slower due to the overhead of classes | Generally faster as it has less overhead |
| **Syntax Complexity**       | More verbose with `class` keyword and `this` keyword | Simpler and cleaner syntax               |
| **Hooks**                   | Cannot use hooks directly                | Can use hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`|
| **Reusability**             | Can be less reusable due to class syntax | Easier to reuse with hooks and simpler syntax |
| **Code Readability**        | Can be harder to read due to complexity  | More concise and easier to read          |
| **Component Instantiation**| Instantiated using `new` keyword         | Instantiated like a normal function      |
